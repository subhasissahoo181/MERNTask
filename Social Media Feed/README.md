 Objective:
 Create a basic social media feed application where users can register, log in,
 upload posts, like and unlike posts, and view a feed of posts from other users.
 Requirements:
 1. User Authentication:- Implement user registration and login functionalities.- Users should be able to securely create an account and log in.
 2. Post Creation:- Authenticated users should be able to create posts.- Each post should have a title, content, and a timestamp.
 3. Post Feed:- Display a feed of posts on the main page.- Posts should show the author's username, post title, content, and
 timestamp.
 4. Like and Unlike:- Users should be able to like and unlike posts.- Display the number of likes for each post.
 Note: Additionally you can also implement the comment feature which allows
 users to comment on each otherâ€™s post. The comments need not be nested
 comments.
 Guidelines:- Use React for the frontend.- Utilise a backend framework like Node.js with Express for handling user
 authentication and managing posts.- Store user data and posts in a MongoDB database.
 Submission:- Share the code repository with clear instructions on how to run the
 application.-Share a video explaining the site and give a clear walkthrough
